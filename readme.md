How to Run the Server
1. Take the URL from the GitHub repo and add it on to the gitPod URL.  Like this: 
  https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/joel-adyen/BYOI
2. In the root folder (where you already are) run: npm install
3. Create a .env file and paste in the secret stuff
4. Run the command: node server.js
4. In GitPod, open the ports tab (near the terminal) and open the port.  It will likely be https://3000-joeladyen-byoi-0nozo67ibq0.ws-us120.gitpod.io/
5. If it is not the same url, you need to add it in Back Office to allowed origins in the API credentials.
